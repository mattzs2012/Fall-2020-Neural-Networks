    "# Toward Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will build toward the next big idea in neural networks: convolutional neural networks (frequently called CNNs or ConvNets). These are nets that take some inspiration from the way neurons are connected in an animal's visual cortex, where different groups of neurons respond to specific portions of the visual field and then those signals are combined in a sort of hierarchy that is thought to allow animals to extract increasingly complex features within the incoming visual stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs are are feedforward neural networks like we have seen, but neurons in one layer are not necessarily connected to every neuron in the next layer. Such a more complex architecture, in some sense, allows a regularized version of fully-connected nets in that, they can generalize better to test data and to the real world. Recall, we could learn the whole training set for CIFAR-10 but had at least a 30% less accuracy on test data. Another benefit is that this more sparse sort of structure means we can build deeper or wider neural nets without growing the computation as much as fully-connected nets.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs are some of the best algorithms for image and video recognition problems, but have also been used effectively in anomaly detection, time series analysis in financial markets, and predicting the interactions between proteins and molecules in drug discovery among other applications."
